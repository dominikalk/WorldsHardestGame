# WorldsHardestGame
I made this from scratch when I was in year 9 using python and the pyame library

To run it you must have python 2.7 installed aswell as pygame 

If you do not, the repository has a folder with the executable download files for them, and from there all you have to do is click the python file.

This took me 1-2 weeks to code at my dad's work during a term holiday. It was from scratch (I drew each ball, and the square and all the boundaries and the background for every level for every frame in code). It is the basis of all my coding skills today as it was what built them. I was so happy with the finished product and at the time (when i was 13) it seemed amazing. Many of my class mates played my game during computing when we were meant to be doing work which always brought a smile to my face.
